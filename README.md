## 📝 Abstract

Cybercrime has become a significant challenge in Nigeria, prompting the enactment of the Cybercrimes Act 2015 to provide a legal framework for its prevention and prosecution. Despite this legislative framework, questions remain regarding the effectiveness of cybercrime prosecution in practice.

This study seeks to examine the challenges associated with prosecuting cybercrime under the Cybercrimes Act 2015. The research is expected to provide insight into the extent to which the current legal and institutional framework facilitates or hinders the prosecution of cybercrime in Nigeria, and it will propose measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the Act.

**Key areas of exploration include:**
* Admissibility of digital evidence.
* Technical capacity within law enforcement agencies.
* Jurisdictional complexities.
* Inter-agency coordination.
* Potential gaps within the Act affecting practical implementation.
